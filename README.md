Hi there!
Thanks for checking out my discord-clone project!

The discord-clone consists elements of Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, and MySQL.
Clerk is used as sign-up/log-in service. 
Livekit is used as audio/video service. 

Link below will take you to the project! (Spoiler: need a Google account to log in.)
